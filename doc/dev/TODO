TODO tasks
==========
Unclassified:
- Fix the TODO and FIXME statements all over in the code
- The android logo should have a white border around it, fix that then regen the logo (http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/05/android-icon-guidelines.html)
- internationalize strings with techniques like: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html#stringresources
- jodatime XML time parsing complains on note loading:
  D/dalvikvm(  194): Ignoring not-yet-ready Lorg/joda/time/DateTime;, using slow path
  I don't want slow path!
- Performance: joda time takes up 30% of the xml parsing time!!
- Replace NoteCollection's structure to a hashmap or hashtable
- Avoid code duplication between NoteBuilder and AsyncNoteLoaderAndParser
- Follow UI design guidelines (http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/activity_task_design.html)

Port threading to Android's mechanism (maybe wait to check for 1.5's new API):
- Check Handler / Looper / AsyncQueryHandler classes

File format: (to be in sync with Tomdroid's)
- Why is title repeated in note text?
- check everrnote dtd for inspiration: http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/

0.2.0 release:
- Verify 1.5 compliance, http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/04/future-proofing-your-apps.html

Market release:
- implement application upgrade mechanism as suggested in http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/publishing.html#marketupgrade
- read / edit notes

Future:
- Check Conboy for UI inspiration (http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=28355)
  Now if only I could find a RichEditView for Android..
