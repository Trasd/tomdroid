TODO tasks
==========
0.3

0.4
- merge Benoit's parse-tags branch revision 107 (would fix notebook bug #360732)
- improve responsiveness when loading notes from sdcard
-- benchmark what's going on
-- confirm: the listview observer over list adapter is eating lots of resources?
- web-sync (if mergeable w/o too much review)
- basic note editing

Unclassified:
- Fix the TODO and FIXME statements all over in the code
- Long-press options on links. How-to: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/acdd8777763b6028
- The android logo should have a white border around it, fix that then regen the logo (http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/05/android-icon-guidelines.html)
- internationalize strings with techniques like: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html#stringresources
- Replace NoteCollection's structure to a hashmap or hashtable
- Avoid code duplication between NoteBuilder and AsyncNoteLoaderAndParser
- Follow UI design guidelines (http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/activity_task_design.html)
- Write a README and INSTALL manual to generate package from source, etc. To be put in project's root

Port threading to Android's mechanism (maybe wait to check for 1.5's new API):
- Check Handler / Looper / AsyncQueryHandler classes

SD card sync:
- Syncing from SD card only adds notes from the SD card and overwrite on identical guid. At some point, we'll have to consider deletions.

File format: (to be in sync with Tomdroid's)
- Why is title repeated in note text?
- check everrnote dtd for inspiration: http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/

Market release:
- implement application upgrade mechanism as suggested in http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/publishing.html#marketupgrade
- read / edit notes

Future:
- Check Conboy for UI inspiration (http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=28355)
  Now if only I could find a RichEditView for Android..
