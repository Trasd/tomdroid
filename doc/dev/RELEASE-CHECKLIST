Make sure to do this before every release:

- Test with "Immediately destroy activities" debug setting
- Increment version number in AndroidManifest.xml (android:versionCode and android:versionName)
- Disable logging (set Tomdroid.LOGGING_ENABLED to false)
- Follow Android's doc on publishing apps to the marketplace
- Test all functionality on emulator 1.1 and 1.5
