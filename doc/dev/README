Tomdroid
TBD

TIPS:
To push your own notes into the emulator for testing, use util/sync-tomboy-tomdroid.sh while you have the emulator running.

BUILDING WITHOUT ECLIPSE
In the branch root, do:
$ android update project -p .
This will create a build.xml and *.properties files. You can now build with:
$ ant debug
and install to a running emulator or a connected device with:
$ ant install
and remove from a running emulator or a connected device with:
$ ant uninstall
