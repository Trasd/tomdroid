Copy your tomboy notes in a tomdroid/ directory inside your sdcard.

You can either:
* Plug in your sdcard and copy the notes to it:
  # mkdir /media/sdcard/tomdroid/; cp ~/.tomboy/*.note /media/sdcard/tomdroid/

* Use adb to push the notes while your phone is plugged in by USB:
  1- Make sure /sdcard/tomdroid/ exists
     # adb shell
     > mkdir /sdcard/tomdroid
     > exit
  2- Pushing the individual note files:
     # adb push <note file> /sdcard/tomdroid/
  3- Repeat step 2 as needed.
