Version 0.2.0 - this is all wrong
Development is done using SDK 1.5 but the application is compatible with 1.x

  list when it's parsing notes and interact with it
* Usability/UI improvements (#364851, Benoît Garret)
* Text no longer changes color when scrolling (#364425)
* Fixed concurrency crashes (#389437)

  when the folder doesn't exist
* Improved usability of the URL input dialog to load a Web note
* Better error reporting to user when loading a note from the Web

* Developer related fixes (#364770)
Version 0.1.0 - the baby eating release
* Show the list of all notes in the tomdroid directory on the sdcard
* View individual Tomboy notes. 
  All formatting tags should be supported.
  Notebooks, tags and addins will not be understood.
* You can load a note from a Web URL.
  In that case, links to other notes won't work.
